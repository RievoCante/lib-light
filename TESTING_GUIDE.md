# Testing Guide - Liberator App

## ‚úÖ I've Fixed the Blue Screen Issue

**What was wrong:** The `MarketHeader` widget had unbounded width constraints causing layout errors.

**What I fixed:**

- Removed the Container wrapper causing constraint issues
- Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to inner Rows
- This should fix all pages (Home, Buy Sell, Portfolio, Content)

**To apply the fix:**

1. Go to your terminal where `flutter run` is running
2. Press `r` key to **hot reload** the app
3. The pages should now display correctly!

## üì± How to Test on iPhone

### Option 1: iPhone Simulator (Recommended for Development)

**Step 1: Open Xcode and set up simulator**

```bash
# Open Xcode
open -a Xcode

# Or use Simulator app directly
open -a Simulator
```

**Step 2: Once Simulator is running, check devices**

```bash
flutter devices
```

You should see something like:

```
iPhone 15 Pro (mobile) ‚Ä¢ <id> ‚Ä¢ ios ‚Ä¢ iOS 17.x (simulator)
```

**Step 3: Run the app on iPhone simulator**

```bash
cd /Users/rievo/Liberator/lib_light_ai
flutter run -d iPhone
```

Or select from available devices:

```bash
flutter run
# Then choose the iPhone option from the list
```

### Option 2: Physical iPhone (For Real Device Testing)

**Step 1: Connect iPhone to Mac via USB**

**Step 2: Trust the computer on your iPhone**

- Unlock your iPhone
- Tap "Trust" when prompted

**Step 3: Check if device is detected**

```bash
flutter devices
```

You should see your iPhone listed.

**Step 4: Run on physical iPhone**

```bash
flutter run -d <your-iphone-id>
```

**Note:** First time running on physical iPhone requires:

- Apple Developer account (free account works)
- Code signing setup in Xcode
- Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and configure signing

### Option 3: iPhone View on Mac (Current Setup)

The macOS app window can be **resized to iPhone dimensions** for quick testing:

**Resize window to iPhone 15 Pro size:**

- Width: 393 points
- Height: 852 points

**Or use this Flutter command:**

```bash
flutter run -d macos --window-size=393,852
```

This gives you iPhone-like dimensions but with macOS rendering.

## üîÑ Hot Reload vs Hot Restart

While the app is running:

| Key | Action      | When to Use                                   |
| --- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `r` | Hot Reload  | After code changes (UI, logic)                |
| `R` | Hot Restart | After adding dependencies, changing providers |
| `q` | Quit        | Stop the app                                  |
